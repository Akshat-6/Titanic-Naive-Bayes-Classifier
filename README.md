# Titanic-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Naive Bayes model built to predict survival on the Titanic dataset, with complete EDA, model evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸš¢ Project: Titanic Survival Prediction using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using the **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.  
The process includes complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, model building, evaluation, and **hyperparameter tuning** to improve performance.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used

The [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) contains information on passengers such as:
- Name, Age, Sex
- Ticket class (Pclass), Fare
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Embarkation point (Embarked)
- Survival status (target)
